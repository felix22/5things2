           <!-- <p><strong>The last productivity hack you'll ever need</strong></p>
            <p>As a memory tool, the to-do list works well a but as a productivity tool its just not as effective as it could be.  </p>
            <p>A recent study by iDoneThis showed that 41% of all toÂ­-do list items are never completed. They often get too long and we run out of time (or give up on the list) before we get to the "important tasks".</p>-->
            
            <p><strong>An Effective Way to Get Things Done On Time</strong></p>
              <ul>
                  <li>At the start of your day, write the 5 most-important things you need to do</li>
                  <li>Start with #1 and</li>
                  <li>Don't stop until you're done (except for breaks)</li>
              </ul> 
                    

              <p><strong>That's it! Do this and you'll never have an unproductive day again.</strong></p>
              <p>Along with the pomodoro technique, this has been the most effective productivity hack I've ever used.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>We're making an app - 5Things - to help you focus ONLY on the most-important things that you need to do every day; so that at the end of the day, you'll have completed the most important tasks of the day, even if you don't have time to do anything else.</p>

              <p>We're making 5Things available <strong>FREE</strong> to a small list of early adopters. If you'll like to be part of this list, enter you email address below to get early access and start using 5Things to improve your productivity.</p>
